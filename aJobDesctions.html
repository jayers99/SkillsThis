<!---->      HealthExpense (http://www.healthexpense.com) is looking for a DevOps Engineer to help us build the next great healthcare technology startup. If you are interested in joining a dynamic early-stage startup that is already seeing significant traction — there are already 1M+ employees using our platform — we’d love to talk to you.<p>
</p><strong>What You Will Do<p>
</p></strong>The DevOps Engineer works collaboratively with software engineering to deploy, operate and scale systems, automating and streamlining operations and processes. You will build and maintain tools for deployment, monitoring and operations, while troubleshooting and resolving issues in the development, test and production environments.<p>
</p><strong>In This Role You Will<p>
</p></strong><ul><li> Create cloud formation templates to build AWS services that support our custom Java/Scala/C++/Native Mobile platform</li><li> Automate and monitor deployment of database and application servers, including Oracle, Postgres, JVM, C++</li><li> Automate, monitor and report on system performance, using Logstash, Kafka, and New Relic</li><li> Implement new tools to increase productivity, security, reliability and performance</li><li> Create and maintain automated application builds (currently Jenkins)</li><li> Document designs, unit test plans and end user guides</li><li> Troubleshoot software related performance issues</li><li> Tackle other duties that pop up … we’re a startup after all.<p>
</p></li></ul><strong>What We’re Looking For<p>
</p></strong>We are looking for candidates with:<p>
</p><ul><li> At least 3-5 years of experience in AWS cloud-based DevOps role (and more is better)</li><li> Strong background in Linux/Unix Administration</li><li> Experience with automation/deployment/configuration management using either Chef, Puppet, Chef or an equivalent</li><li> Ability to use a wide variety of open source technologies and cloud services</li><li> Strong experience in automating and monitoring database and application servers (Oracle, Postgres, JVM, C++)</li><li> A working understanding of code and script (PHP, Python, Perl and/or Ruby, or an equivalent)</li><li> Knowledge of best practices and IT operations in an always-up, always-available service</li><li> Experience with automating monitors and system performance reporting (Logstash, Kafka, and New Relic)<p>

</p><p>Our technology stack is modern and always changing, but we are thoughtful and deliberate about bringing new technologies. The majority of  our services are Docker containers running in Mesos backed by MongoDB, ElasticSearch, Postgres, RabbitMQ, and a bevy of AWS technologies. </p><p>
</p><p>You should be comfortable using best-in-industry tools such as Terraform, Ansible, Packer, and Chef to automate everything you should, and develop tools with Python, Ruby, or Bash to tailor solutions when needed. </p><p>
</p><p>We develop tools such as push-button environment creation and consistent stacks for local development on laptops to empower software developers. We support automation tools like Jenkins, Teamcity. </p><p>
</p><p>You should expect to use tools such as Splunk, Datadog, and New Relic to get a global understanding of the system, but also be able to break-glass troubleshoot in a shell on individual machines. </p><p>
</p><p>On-call rotation is part of the role, as you might expect, but we support each other and work hard to make that not suck. </p><p>
</p><p>Since we manage healthcare data, we must comply with HIPAA and related laws, and good decision-making and data-defensive thinking are critical for our team members. We are especially interested in candidates who have strong experience in DB administration (relational and/or NoSQL), “Big Data” pipelines, or who have worked in a HITRUST-guided or regulated environment. </p><p>
</p><p>Our culture is important to us and we cultivate it carefully. We do not strive for heroism and while we recognize and reward individual accomplishments, we know that ultimately, teams win. Most of our projects are paired work and several of our team members are embedded in development teams. We are enthusiastic about infrastructure as code, scalability and building partnerships with engineering that foster a healthy DevOps culture. </p><p>
</p><p>Our projects are run without regard to geography. You will be working on teams with members in Washington, D.C., Chicago, and San Francisco, and we welcome applications to any of those offices. </p><p>
</p><p>Our benefits package is highly competitive with others in tech, offering great options that attend to your physical, emotional, financial and career health.  We have low deductible, modest employee contribution health care options through UnitedHealth, and an option for a higher deductible plan accompanied by an HSA that Rally pays for. We have vision and dental care, disability income protection, FSA, and life insurance benefits that extend to you and your dependents. We serve catered lunch each day and stock the kitchen with snacks for those of us who need to be reminded to eat. And, of course, we grant to our employees access to the Rally Engage app that offers challenges and incentives to keep us well.  On the emotional well-being side of things, we know that people who work as hard as Rallyers need to catch their breath. So, we offer PTO-with-trust; meaning, you take it when you need it and we don't add up how much you've used. For those that need a little extra care, we are partnering with Ginger.io to make employee support accessible via text. Financially, we offer competitive cash compensation and equity, 401k matching, and surprise bonuses to those who surprise us with their contributions. And, perhaps most importantly, we offer a company with a purpose, jobs that demand your very best work, and opportunities to learn, grow, and build your career. </p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Rally Health is committed to ensuring that its workforce reflects America’s diverse population.  Rally Health knows that such diversity will enrich us with the talent, energy, perspective and inspiration it needs to achieve its mission.  Rally Health believes in a policy of equal employment and opportunity for all people based on merit and commitment to the principles of diversity.  It is our policy to recruit, hire, train, and promote individuals in all job titles, and administer all programs, without regard to race, color, religion, national origin or ancestry, citizenship, sex, age, marital status, pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions, personal appearance, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, family responsibilities, genetic information, disability, matriculation, political affiliation, veteran status, union affiliation, or any other category protected by applicable federal, state or local laws. </p><p>
</p><p>Individuals with disabilities and veterans are encouraged to apply.  Applicants who require an accommodation related to the application and/or review process should notify our recruiting team (recruiting@rallyhealth.com). </p><p>Pursuant to the San Francisco Fair Chance Ordinance, we will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records</p>

<!---->      <p>As a DevOps Engineer at Clara, you will architect, implement, and administer our AWS-based infrastructure. In addition, you will lead and contribute to the development of tools that help us monitor, configure, and scale our infrastructure. You will use your experience and expertise in both preventative and responsive situations. DevOps is already part of our engineering team’s DNA, so rather than dealing with daily operations and on-call schedules, you’ll get to create the tools and frameworks that empower and guide our developers to operate their own services effectively. </p><p></p><p>
</p> <p></p><p>WHAT YOU'LL DO:</p><p>
</p> <p></p><p></p><p>
</p> <p></p><p></p><p>
</p> <p></p><ul><li>Make the most efficient use of DevOps technologies such as Docker, Terraform, and Chef. Implement the right tool for the job when necessary </li><li>Use understanding and empathy for your customers to produce a highly efficient environment </li><li>Contribute to an environment that enables our engineering teams to build, release, and operate their own microservices </li><li>Participate in architecting, implementing, and administering our AWS-based infrastructure to support consumer-facing web applications, backend business workflow engines, and data pipelines </li></ul><p>
</p><p>ABOUT YOU:</p><p>
</p> <p></p><p>
</p><ul><li>You see both sides of DevOps - development and operations, and see how they are intertwined and influence each other. You adopt the philosophies behind DevOps and enjoy working in such collaborative environments. </li><li>You care about continuous integration, reliable deployments, sensible configuration management, etc., because they catch errors early and improve both system stability and developer efficiency </li><li>You’re lazy in the right ways - you have  a focus on building tools, systems and patterns, not manual firefighting </li><li>You have built reusable systems, and are familiar with modern tools to reliably, consistently and repeatedly manage them - solid, supported, and maintained tools; not: post-it notes, tribal knowledge, or prayer </li><li>You are well-versed in security best practices and defense mechanisms, and you have practiced them consistently </li><li>4+ years of experience as a DevOps Engineer, Systems Engineer or Systems Administrator </li><li>2+ years managing a non-trivial system architecture in AWS. Our current system has ~200 nodes serving 2 web applications, with more than a dozen back-end microservices across several environments; this is likely to grow significantly to support on-demand environments, more complex analytics, additional workflows, etc.</li></ul>

<!---->      AtScale bridges the gap between business users and their data.<p>
</p>The average enterprise sits on a mountain of data that business users could use to drive better performance. Unfortunately, most enterprises are not equipped to gain value out of their data: according to Forrester, close to 75% of the data stored within an enterprise goes unused. Enterprises need ways to deliver data to business users with simplicity, speed and security.<p>
</p>Back in 2009 at Yahoo!, AtScale’s founding team experienced this first hand, and witnessed the power and potential of Hadoop. However, we struggled to make the data in Hadoop accessible to the business users who needed it. Tired of moving data into expensive, legacy databases, the AtScale team decided to build what they could not buy.<p>
</p>Infrastructure and systems don’t need to suck; we believe deep understanding of fundamentals and solid engineering cure most woes. We are looking for a startup-friendly, devops person to work with the latest Hadoop tech. This is a challenging position and a great opportunity to learn the latest technologies used in the data space.<p>
</p>We strive to make our interview process effective. We can probably get a bunch out of the way if you have some public Github code, or open source contributions we can look at. Our goal is to run the interview cycle and come to a conclusion within a week.<p>
</p>Regularly scheduled after hours support is not required as there is no on-call rotation!<p>
</p><strong>Desired Skills &amp; Experience<p>
</p></strong><ul><li> Has a foundation in a language like Python or Ruby but feels confident to jump into a new languages</li><li> Has experience with configuration management systems such as Puppet, Ansible, CFEngine, or Chef </li><li> Will automate everything</li><li> Proficiency of Linux at a systems administration level</li><li> Hands-on experience with Jenkins, Git, Docker</li><li> Can work closely with developers to solve systems problems. Blur the line between ops and dev</li><li> Can optimize like crazy; squeeze every bit of performance out of servers</li><li> Can help build a great company<p>
</p></li></ul><strong>Nice To Haves<p>
</p></strong><ul><li>Has experience with business intelligence concepts</li><li>Has experience with Hadoop, and Hadoop-ish stuff like Spark.</li><li>A literal or metaphoric Beard of Unix Mastery</li><li>Can change hardware (disks, laptops, servers, etc.); support network, desktop, and security</li></ul>

</p></strong>The DocuSign Mobile Team is looking for a highly motivated engineer to help bring our industry-leading electronic signature and transaction management platform to iOS. We already have the best e-signature app on the market and our users love it, but we know we can do better.

</p>The successful candidate will have a strong product engineering background and proficiency in both Swift and Objective-C. As an ideal candidate, you will be passionate about product quality and user experience and will feel equally at home debugging a Core Data migration, laying out views using size classes, or making a rebound animation feel natural using UIDynamics. You also have a list of your favorite iOS features from the latest WWDC and have experience building your own apps. If Cocoa is second nature for you and you dream of winning an Apple Design Award, then we want to talk to you!<p>

</p><strong>Responsibilities<p>
</p></strong><ul> <li>Work as part of a passionate, agile development team to deliver engaging native user experiences</li> <li>Collaborate with our platform engineering teams to implement new features and to bring existing platform features into mobile</li> <li>Work closely with quality engineers to identify test cases and devise efficient, scalable testing processes</li> <li>Write and maintain unit and functional tests for every feature</li> <li>Work cooperatively with product management and design to create features that satisfy user needs with simplicity, consistency, and robustness</li> <li>Identify, propose, and implement process improvements to continuously increase the team's productivity and efficiency</li> <li>Work with development teams from other top tech companies to build features together</li> <li>Maintain and evolve the software architecture for current and future needs</li> <li>Stay current with the latest development best practices and share your findings with the team</li> <li>Be an active part of the iOS developer community by attending conferences and writing developer blog posts</li> <li>Live on the bleeding edge; we support new features alongside each iOS release</li> <p>
</p></ul><strong>Basic Qualifications<p>
</p></strong><ul> <li>B.S. in Computer Science or similar field of study</li> <li>5+ years of overall software product development and/or cloud/SaaS/enterprise software engineering experience</li> <li>2+ years writing native iOS apps with a large-scale cloud/SaaS back end</li> <li>One or more apps available in the App Store with a large-scale cloud/SaaS back end</li> <li>Experience with the entire iOS development lifecycle, including version control, build process, testing, and build distribution to both internal testers and the App Store</li> <p>
</p></ul><strong>Preferred Qualifications<p>
</p></strong><ul> <li>Excellent verbal and written communication skills</li> <li>Strong attention to detail</li> <li>Passion to learn new software technologies</li> <li>Natural aptitude for both teaching and learning from others in a collaborative team environment</li> <p>
</p></ul><strong>Engineering @DocuSign<p>
</p></strong>A problem that takes 5 minutes to solve is not interesting. A problem that takes 5 years to solve is fun. We like to think about complex, global challenges that cross cultures and legal jurisdictions and that impact millions of people and businesses. We hire people with a broad set of skills, and they are working on how to create never-been-done-before solutions that scale.

<!---->      Since 2013, we have been on a mission to build better products through the lens of machine learning. Weand#39;re not here to reinvent consumer behavior, but rather we seek to understand existing habits and created better experiences for our users and customers. Under this driving mission, our team has launched three consumer properties with over 100M users across 97 countries. Chatous, Kiwi, and Plaza operate in different verticals - messaging, QandA, and local commerce respectively, however, they are aligned with the intent to connect an increasingly mobile world, and are optimized through our machine learning platform. In addition, we serve enterprise customers through Hive. The Hive platform combines machine learning and an on-demand human workforce to deliver highly accurate classification services.The ultimate goal of Castle is to bring machine learning into applications that represent core consumer behaviors. We believe that the next wave of transformative consumer properties, whether produced directly by Castle or not, will be built upon our machine learning platform.In order to execute this vision, we need to grow our team of best in class engineers. The ideal candidate is a team player, but has the initiative to take on projects of your own. You are receptive to feedback and an open collaborator, who prioritizes team success. You are constantly learning, and using new tools and technology to broaden your skill set as a developer. You care deeply about the user experience, and refuse to ship a product that is mediocre for our users.The ProductPlaza was created in 2016 with the goal of building a mobile first global classified platform.<p>
</p>Our US team noticed that how we sell used items hadnandrsquo;t changed at all in the era of smartphones.<p>
</p>We were finding ourselves taking pictures of items using our smart phone, and then emailing those pictures to our laptop before we posted our for sale ads on craigslist.<p>
</p>Our founders believed there was a better way and it finally might be time to disrupt craigslist, and Plaza was born.<p>
</p>We quickly learned that we werenandrsquo;t the only ones with this insight and we were suddenly faced with better capitalized incumbents as well as emerging players.<p>
</p>It seemed to us that everyone was aiming to outspend each other to win the market, so our team vowed to not follow the herd. And then we set out to build core technology to create the best mobile platform for global classifieds.<p>
</p>The question for us now is can a small team of brilliant engineers combined with some luck win the mobile classified wars?ResponsibilitiesMaintain a clean and extensible code base.Take ownership of whole project on your own, but also willing to be a contributing member of your iOS development team as a whole.Work across disciplines with team members from front-end, backend, design, and product to ship features.Help maintain our shared internal frameworks and create some of your own.Actively participate in product decisions, ensuring we set reasonable development deadline and create quality user experiences.Help improve our development processes.About YouBS Degree in Computer Science, or similar from a top university.You are comfortable writing solid Swift and/or Objective-C.You owned, or were a primary contributor, to the development of an application on the app store.You are knowledgeable of new technologies, open source frameworks and commonly used design patterns.Fundamentals in OO-design, data structures, and problem solving.You have experience shipping quickly and often.You are a team player -- no job is too small, or too big!

Develop diagnostic and troubleshooting tools made available via our developer portal and to our customer support organization.</li> <li>Excel as an engineer and be a productive member of the team where leadership is a behavioral trait, not a title. Lead architecture, design and code reviews as well as mentor junior engineers.</li> <p>
</p></ul><strong>Requirements<p>
</p></strong><ul> <li>Minimum 5 years hands-on experience developing and scaling complex distributed systems based on Java, C++ or .NET technologies. You are an expert in at least one web stack and framework.</li> <li>Extensive experience scaling production backend systems.

</p><p>As an Infrastructure Engineer at BigCommerce, you’ll work as part of our Technical Operations team. Our Infrastructure Engineering team consists of a talented group of individuals who specialize not only in web operations and systems administration, but also software engineering. We’re charged with designing the underlying technology stack that powers BigCommerce stores, and building the underlying systems and tools that enable engineering teams to build and ship BigCommerce services. </p><p>
</p><p>We’re looking for an experienced candidate who brings a blended set of skills for software engineering and web operations to our team. In other organizations, you might have heard of this referred to as a “DevOps Engineer”. We like to believe DevOps is an idea, a theory, and a set of fundamentals about how we work and interact within our team, in engineering, and for our business. </p><p>
</p><p>Currently you’ll find us predominately working in Ruby, and PHP, backed up by Puppet for configuration management. We’ve also been known to work in JVM based languages (Scala), and with Go from time to time.

Your systems and scripts are clean, well-documented and comprehensible </p></li><li><p>You have a passion for learning when it comes to working with new technologies or languages </p></li></ul><strong><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p> <p></p>Who you are:</strong><p>Our ideal candidate possesses some or of the following skills: </p><p>
</p><ul><li><p>3-5 year experience in building software for, operating, or supporting large Linux based web application environments </p></li><li><p>Experience with UNIX systems administration, including solid scripting skills in Ruby, PHP, or Bash </p></li><li><p>Experience running Docker with some kind of orchestration system such as Nomad, Kubernetes, or Amazon ECS (we use Nomad) </p></li><li><p>Knowledge of configuration management systems such as Puppet, or Chef (we use Puppet) </p></li><li><p>Experience with popular tools for monitoring web applications (we use New Relic, Nagios, Graphite, and StatsD to name a few) </p></li></ul><strong><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p> <p></p>Curious What We’ve Been Up To?</strong><p>Curious what our Infrastructure Engineering team has been up to or some of our upcoming roadmap items you could have the opportunity to be involved in? </p><p>
</p><ul><li><p>We’ve designed and built out our Docker container environment, orchestrated by Nomad, with Consul for service registration, and Vault for secrets management (we’re big fans of HashiCorp software) </p></li><li><p>Our team has built an all new shared load balancer environment, which powers the ingress traffic for all services in our SOA environment. We used a combination of DNS based traffic distribution, IPVS/LVS load balancing, and HAProxy. New services and backends automatically register against our load balancers using consul and consul-template </p></li><li><p>We have built and deployed an internal services mesh for HTTP 1 and gRPC (H2) traffic using linkerd, which allows our services to discover each other, talk securely, and handle failures gracefully </p></li><li><p>We’re in the process of deploying deploying BGP to manage network advertisements between our data centers, and enable us to automatically divert traffic through our DDoS mitigation provider. We’re also working on deploying our own L7 web-app firewalls in nginx</p></li></ul>

Fundamental to our mission to help build a better Internet is protecting the free and open Internet. In 2014, we launched Project Galileo, an initiative through which we partner with global NGOs to identify websites at risk of attack and provide the same state-of-the-art mitigation technology already used by Cloudflare’s enterprise customers--at no cost. Project Galileo equips politically and artistically important organizations and journalists with powerful tools to defend themselves against attacks that would otherwise censor their work.<p>
</p>Additionally, in 2016, we announced our partnership with Path Forward, a nonprofit organization that works with companies to create 18-week positions for mid-career professionals who want to get back to the workplace after taking time off to care for a child, parent, or loved one. With the lofty goal of shaping the future of the Internet, we’re focused on recruiting the best and the brightest, no matter what.<p>
</p>Cloudflare is a security company. A successful background check is required for employment.<p>

      <h2 class="jobs-description-content__title  jobs-box__title">Job description</h2>
<!---->      As a platform company powering businesses all over the world, Stripe processes payments, runs marketplaces, detects fraud, helps entrepreneurs start an internet business from anywhere in the world, builds world-class developer-friendly APIs, and more. Stripe’s backend engineers work on the business logic for all of that. As a backend engineer, you will build and expand APIs and services and work with our partners to launch new markets,payment methods, and capabilities.<p>
</p>We have backend engineers in almost every team across Stripe, and in that role, you’ll be making some of the most significant decisions for the company. You’ll get to work with other engineers to build delightful features that span various parts of the system, as well as our business, sales and operations teams to understand and solve our users’ pain points.<p>
</p>We’re looking for people with strong background or interest in building successful products or systems; you’re comfortable in dealing with lots of moving pieces; you have exquisite attention to detail; and you’re comfortable learning new technologies and systems.<p>
</p><strong>You Will<p>
</p></strong><ul><li>Design, build, and maintain APIs, services, and systems across Stripe’s engineering teams</li> <li>Debug production issues across services and multiple levels of the stack</li> <li>Work with engineers across the company to build new features at large-scale</li> <li>Improve engineering standards, tooling, and processes</li> <p>
</p></ul><strong>You May Be Fit For This Role If You<p>
</p></strong><ul><li>Enjoy and have experience building APIs</li> <li>Think about systems and services and write high quality code. We work mostly in Ruby, with some Scala and Go. However, languages can be learned: we care much more about your general engineering skill than knowledge of a particular language or framework.</li> <li>Hold yourself and others to a high bar when working with production systems</li> <li>Take pride in working on projects to successful completion involving a wide variety of technologies and systems.</li> <li>Thrive in a collaborative environment involving different stakeholders and subject matter experts</li> <li>Enjoy working with a diverse group of people with different expertise (for example, ¼ of Stripes work in a country that’s different from the one they grew up in). Almost every role at Stripe collaborates with some engineers, from Sales and Support in sharing feedback from our customers; to Legal and Accounting in supporting our systems for tracking money movement and reporting around the world.</li> <p>
</p></ul>It’s not expected that any single candidate would have expertise across all of these areas. For instance, we have wonderful team members who are really focused on their customers’ needs and building amazing user experiences, but didn’t work on APIs before joining Stripe.<p>
</p><strong>You Might Work On<p>
</p></strong><ul><li>Build a new API for our users, or iterate on existing APIs</li> <li>Launch a new market or payment method</li> <li>Work with our Analytics and Fraud teams to reduce chargebacks and declines</li> <li>Build new tools for our business teams</li> <li>Build new systems to securely store sensitive data</li> <p>
</p></ul>What’s it like to work at Stripe?<p>
</p>Stripe is helping the internet fulfill its potential as a platform for economic progress by building software tools that accelerate global economic access and technological development. Stripe makes it easy to start, run and scale an internet business from anywhere in the world.<p>
</p>Stripe is, at its heart, an engineering company. To provide a missing pillar of core internet infrastructure, we hire people with a broad set of technical skills (and from a wide variety of backgrounds) who are ready to take on some of the most challenging problems in the industry – from reliably handling 100M API requests per day, to building adaptive machine learning as a result of years of data science and infrastructure work, and enabling entrepreneurs worldwide to start a global internet business.<p>
</p>We look at Stripe as a constant work in progress and the same is true of our people; for all of us, we believe the best is yet to come. We’re here to support each other in our curiosity and creativity – which we pursue through thoughtful discussion and knowledge-sharing among a diverse set of peers and colleagues.<p>
</p>We encourage all engineers to transition teams once every year and a half and also take on short-term projects with other teams across Stripe. This enables engineers to learn how different parts of Stripe work while also establishing stronger ties and cross-pollination between groups.<p>
</p>We contribute to existing open-source projects and the people working on them, and we release several tools as open-source.<p>
</p>We want to work in a company of warm, inclusive people who treat their colleagues exceptionally well. The kind of people who are committed to going out of their way to help other Stripes in the short-term and pushing them to improve over the long-term (by helping them to get better at what they do).<p>
</p>We’re a highly cross-functional organization and view that as part of the fun: we design our space to encourage as much collaboration as possible. We have long tables in the kitchen for a reason (to enable everyone to meet new people and learn from them). We also have a culture of transparency that we carry through to email communication, ensuring that Stripes all around the world have the information they need to make good local decisions.<p>
</p>In both our products and our people, we aim to reflect, represent and advocate for all of our users, globally. Our users transcend geography, culture and language; what we share, collectively, is a drive to create a fairer, more economically interconnected world.<p>

<!---->      <strong>Overview<p>
</p></strong>At Segment, we believe companies should be able to send their data wherever they want, whenever they want, with no fuss. We make this easy with a single platform that collects, stores and sends data to hundreds of business tools with the flip of a switch. Segment makes using data easy, and we’re looking for people to help us. We are passionate about building toward a world where engineers at other companies spend their time working on their core product, rather than spending nights and weekends tweaking their customer data into various formats for 3rd party tools.<p>
</p>The Tooling Team at Segment’s goal is to empower other teams with effective tooling to accomplish their technical work. We ensure that our shared logging, metrics, and deployment infrastructure are world-class; that our software development process iterates quickly; and that internal and external services are organized and well administrated. When you’re blocked on some shared part of the system outside of your team’s expertise, Tooling is the response team that can pull something together to get you working productively again.<p>
</p>Who We Are<p>
</p>We’re a small team of experienced engineers with diverse technical backgrounds. We’re passionate about driving our coworkers’ success and building the next generation of software tooling. If you want to work on distributed systems infrastructure and development practices or you have an entrepreneurial spirit and want to make something that your peers use every day, we’d love for you to join us.<p>
</p>Tooling handles many different areas, so we’re building a diverse team with a wide range of expertise.<p>
</p>What We Do<p>
</p><strong>Shared Infrastructure<p>
</p></strong>It’s hard to build complex distributed systems unless your logging, metrics, deployment infrastructure, and shared libraries are shipshape. That’s what we’re here for :-)<p>
</p>Read more about Segment’s infrastructure and how we use: distributed logging and secure secrets. Or, read our code: conf, ksuid, cwlogs, go-prompt, ecs-logs, chamber<p>
</p><strong>Developer Productivity<p>
</p></strong>We have some of the best and brightest engineers working at Segment. If our develop→build→test→deploy cycle starts to suck, we’re going to waste a lot of super valuable time. We manage the tooling and process around development environments, testing, CI, and deployment.<p>
</p>Read more on our blog about how we use: CI and Make.<p>
</p><strong>System Administration<p>
</p></strong>We need more than high quality tooling. Tools need to be adopted and supported by experts when problems arise. A lot of our tooling and infrastructure is SaaS; those services tend to need more administration than development. Tooling is here to help.<p>
</p>Read more about how we manage our AWS services and costs.<p>
</p><strong>Organizational</strong> <strong>Efficiency<p>
</p></strong>The engineering, analytics, biz-ops, and technical support teams at Segment are dependent on the tooling we maintain to carry out their day to day work. We make sure that they have secure and effective tools to get the information they need from our infrastructure and operate the business.<p>
</p>Projects You Could Help With<p>
</p><ul> <li>Per-Engineer Dev Environments</li> <li>Logging Pipeline Development</li> <li>AWS Rate Limit Monitoring</li> <li>Application Deployment Improvements</li> <li>Self-Hosted CI</li> <li>Incident Management Automation</li> <li>Large Scale JSON Stream Data Manipulation Tools</li> <li>Standardized Metrics and Alerting Infrastructure</li> <li>Consistent Runbooks and Documentation</li> <p>
</p></ul><strong>Requirements<p>
</p></strong><ul> <li>Minimum of 3 years experience as a software engineer, devops engineer, or site reliability engineer</li> <li>You have experience with AWS, Docker, Golang, Node.js, or Terraform</li> <li>You are motivated to support your coworkers and make them productive</li> <li>You are a self-directed problem solver</li> <p>
</p></ul>Bonus<p>
</p><ul> <li>You've worked on or with a variety of engineering teams</li> <li>You've had experience as a system administrator</li> <li>You've worked in analytics, biz-ops, or technical support in the SaaS industry</li> <li>You’ve had experience leading teams or projects</li> <p>
</p></ul>TTYL<p>
</p>Wow! Good work reading through that long job description. I hope you’re excited!<p>
</p>Before you go, I’d like to mention that Segment is an equal opportunity employer. We believe that everyone should receive equal consideration and treatment. Recruitment, hiring, placements, transfers, and promotions will happen based on qualifications for the positions being filled regardless of sex, gender identity, race, religious creed, color, national origin ancestry, age, physical disability, pregnancy, mental disability, or medical condition.<p>
